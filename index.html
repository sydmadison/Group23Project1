Everything was beautifully presented from the fresh salads to the elegantly plated fruit platters. Planning food for a wedding is normally stressful, but the Khaana team made planning the menu so easy and stress-free. If I ever get remarried, I'll definitely use Khaana again!"<br />

The food was very flavorful and well-presented, and the staff was so efficient with setting up and serving. I can't wait to have the opportunity to work with Khaana for my next event."<br />

The staff was very professional and went the extra mile to make sure that everything we needed was taken care of. They had a variety of healthy menu options that satisfied even the pickiest of eaters among our staff. Thank you Khaana team for another great food and service experience!"<br />

Working with Khaana was an absolutely amazing experience for my son's graduation party. His restricted diet makes it hard to find food that is healthy and fits his dietary needs, but Khaana went above and beyond preparing food that not only fit his dietary needs, but was healthy and delicious that all of the guests enjoyed."<br />
